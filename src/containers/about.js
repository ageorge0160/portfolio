    <p>My name is Amanda George and I recently completed the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp through the Flatiron School. I was a National Park Ranger and outdoor adventure guide before learning to code. I am also a nature photographer and for each of the new places I was working in I would create a photo website for my family to be able to see the pictures I was taking. I tried many of the build-your-own website options, but was always wanting to change different parts of the site. My dive into coding came from a desire to better understand what my dadâ€™s profession as a database administrator and as a way to build my own photography site. As soon as I started I was hooked. As a ranger and guide I was constantly learning new skills and information and using project planning and problem solving to create unique ways of sharing stories with others. Coding tapped into these same skills and has the benefit of not being weather dependent. I am loving my journey as a web developer and am continuing to grow my skills as I look for a role as a web developer in the Twin Cities.</p>
